# SocialMedia-SprBoot-REST-Hibernate-PostgreSQL

RESTful API for a simple social media application using Spring Boot, Hibernate, and PostgreSQL. The application should allow users to create and view posts, follow other users, and like posts. Each post should have a title, body, and author. Hibernate persists the post and user data in the database.

The code is in the developer branch.

I launched the project from Intellij IDEA.

Feedback:

- Was it easy to complete the task using AI?

- It's not exactly easy. I have to constantly monitor and adjust everything. When AI fix one issue or add something new, another problem often pops up elsewhere — it's an ongoing cycle. From my experience on this project, it became clear that, at its current stage of development, AI can't fully replace programmers. That said, it's undeniably a major breakthrough and provides invaluable support in a developer's workflow.

For example, there was one issue involving MapStruct that ChatGPT couldn’t resolve, even after several iterations. Ultimately, I had to step in and manually adjust the pom.xml settings myself. Thankfully, I had prior experience with similar projects, so I knew what to do.

- How long did task take you to complete?

- It took me around 7 hours to complete the project. Honestly, I’d love to meet the person who managed to do it in an hour and a half, as the task description suggests — that would be some really Batman-level programmer and AI master.


- Was the code ready to run after generation? What did you have to change to make it usable?

- The code wasn’t ready to run right away — and honestly, I didn’t expect it to be. It was an iterative process: with every new feature added or issue fixed, something else would often break elsewhere. I had to keep a constant overview of the whole system to make sure everything stayed functional. Every step required attention and adjustments — it definitely wasn’t a “generate and forget” situation.

- Which challenges did you face during completion of the task?

- One of the main challenge was - the code wasn’t ready to run immediately — which I more or less expected. It was an iterative process: I had to constantly fix bugs, refine logic, and add functionality. Every time something was changed or added in one part of the code, something else could break elsewhere. So I had to maintain a clear overview and keep everything under control throughout the process.

Another delay was due to the constant waiting for a response — until the AI had finished generating everything, it was impossible to copy or continue working. Plus, I had to periodically remind the AI to be brief — to give answers without long explanations.


- Which specific prompts you learned as a good practice to complete the task?

- I can't say I discovered some particularly specific prompts, but I did realize that it's important to move step by step — to break the task into smaller parts and check each result along the way. At the same time, I had to ask the AI to respond without explanations — long, detailed answers only slowed down the process.
